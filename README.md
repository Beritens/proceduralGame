unfinished Unity Game

this game started with me just messing around with marching cubes. It was really fun so I continued.
I added a infinite world, a way to interact with the world.
Because of the bad performance I had to learn how to use multiple threads.

Sadly I don't know what to do with it anymore and my passion for this project is gone so I'll leave it unfinished.
